# Cloud

Welcome to the Cloud section.


## Introduction

This section is designed to help you understand core concepts through real-world examples, scenarios, and hands-on command usage.

Learning here is focused on practical clarity, not theory.

---

## Why this matters

In real systems, you will often face situations where:

- Things break unexpectedly
- Logs are unclear
- Documentation is missing
- Systems behave differently in production

This knowledge helps you debug, reason, and fix those issues.

---

## Common Workflow

A typical workflow looks like this:

1. Identify the problem
2. Reproduce it
3. Understand the root cause
4. Apply a fix
5. Verify
6. Document

---

## Example

Let us say you are troubleshooting a service.

```bash
ps aux | grep nginx
You might then inspect logs, check ports, and validate configs.

Notes

Always prefer understanding over memorization.
Tools change. Fundamentals do not.
